<h2>Taco Bell!</h2>
<section>
<p>
I once did an entire presentation about taco bell for a public speaking course I took at the old University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh Fond du Lac Campus.
<br>A lot of students made jokes afterwords, but that didn't change my feelings about the Big Bell!</br>
Some of my favorite items in ranked order include:
<ol>
	<li>The Mexican Pizza</li>
	<li>The Cheesy Gordita Crunch</li>
	<li>The Nachos Bell Grande</li>
	<li>Can't forget the <b>Nacho Fries!</b></li>

<h2>The Yakuza Game Series!</h2>
<p>I once found Yakuza 0 for sale on steam for $5, and the rest is history. I've played them all <i>thoroughly.</i>
