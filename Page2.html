			<h2>Taco Bell!</h2>
			<p>I once did an entire presentation about taco bell for a public speaking course I took at the old University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh Fond du Lac Campus.
				<br>A lot of students made jokes afterwords, but that didn't change my feelings about the Big Bell!</br>
				Some of my favorite items in ranked order include:
				<ol>
					<li>The Mexican Pizza</li>
					<li>The Cheesy Gordita Crunch</li>
					<li>The Nachos Bell Grande</li>
					<li>Can't forget the <b>Nacho Fries!</b>
				</li>

			<h2>The Yakuza Game Series!</h2>
			<p>I once found Yakuza 0 for sale on steam for $5, and the rest is history. I've played them all <i>thoroughly.</i></p>
